Previously i worked on certain Data science projects.

I addressed the problem of ATR (Automatic Target Recognition) in airborne sensor systems involving SAR sensors, 
using relevant Deep Learning algorithms and also addressed the problem of identifying natural or man-made disasters of Oil spill by applying Deep Learning algorithms 
to segment SAR images. 

I also proposed architecture of a deep learning algorithm for military air traffic control interrogation systems, Identification Friend or Foe to identify IFF mode code.

My published research papers:
SAR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING TRANSFER LEARNING | Data Science, Machine learning, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Python.
